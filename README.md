# hotel-reservation-system

This is a group project that was created for the class ICS-125 (Software Engineering Process) at Camosun College.

We were a team of three, tasked with making a basic hotel reservation system using Java and the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern.

This project was developed in NetBeans and uses the Maven build system, Java Swing with the NetBeans AbsoluteLayout LayoutManager for GUI elements, and MySQL/MariaDB with the mysql-connector-j for database connection.

This is a more polished version of the project that contains more changes that have been made since the course has ended.
