# hotel-reservation-system

This is a group project that I was a part of for the class ICS-125 (Software Engineering Process) at Camosun College.

We were a team of three and we were tasked with making a basic hotel reservation system using Java and the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern.

This project uses ANT and all dependencies that must be added to the project can be found in the lib/ folder.

This is a more polished version of the project that contains changes that I have made individually after we turned it in as a group.
